<h2 id="background">Background and release</h2>
<p>"Where Is My Mind?" is the seventh track on the Pixies' 1988 debut album Surfer Rosa. The song was written by frontman Black Francis while he attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, inspired by his experiences while scuba diving in the Caribbean. He later said he had "this very small fish trying to chase me. I don't know whyâ€”I don't know too much about fish behavior."[1] A live version of the song recorded at 2004's Coachella was released free through BitTorrent.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Cultural impact</h2>
<p>After being featured in the 1999 film Fight Club, the song gained an even wider audience and became iconic.[3][4] "Where Is My Mind?" was voted number 29 in the "Hottest 100 of All Time" music poll conducted by Australian radio station Triple J in 2009.[5] Over half a million votes were cast in the poll.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, April 13, 2004, NASA used "Where Is My Mind?" to wake up the team working on the Mars rover, Spirit, in honor of its software transplant.</p>

<p>Maxence Cyrin's piano cover of the song is also a common trope on television, having been featured in TV shows such as The Leftovers and Mr. Robot.</p>

<p>End of Fashion have been criticized for their uncredited copying of the guitar riff from the "Where Is My Mind?", for their song "O Yeah". For example, Rockus Online Magazine reviewer Jonathon Miller called the song "disturbingly Pixies-ish" and went on to write:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"End of Fashion are having no problem appealing to the 95% of people that haven't heard (and still remember) the Pixies' "Where Is My Mind?" and have never experienced a truly exciting live show, and if that's what the band is aiming for, then they are a complete success."</p>
